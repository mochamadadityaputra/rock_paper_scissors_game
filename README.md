# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game with Emojis 🎮
Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game repository! This is a simple Python implementation of the classic hand game, now with a fun twist: emojis! 🎉

## 📝 About the Project
This project is a playful take on the traditional game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, where the player competes against the computer. The game uses emoji icons to represent each choice, making the game more visually appealing and fun to play!

The game:
-  Lets the player choose between rock 🪨, paper 📄, or scissors ✂️.
-  Randomly generates the computer’s choice.
-  Determines the winner based on standard game rules.
-  Allows the player to keep playing until they choose to stop.
